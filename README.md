# Challege 4 (soccer) fixes
- After importing the Challenge 4 assets, the Unit 4 player texture is removed, re-add it.

- When attempting to remedy Challenge 4 problem 1, scene isn't playable because EnemyX.cs script is missing a GameObject reference to PlayerGoal. Fixed by using a tag on Player Goal:

private void Awake()
    {
            playerGoal = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("PlayerGoal");
    }
